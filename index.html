<h1> Health  </h1>
<p> Health is very important. I feel like good health equals good life. In order to do something in life, you need a 
    good health. <strong>Money is not that important as much as your helath is.</strong> Everybody should take care of their health. 
    Eat healthy, do some exercise everyday would be the first step toward a good health. <strong> Health is not just about physical health,
    mental health is also very important. </strong> We should go out in nature, read, give time to ourself, do things that we like
    for our own mental health. Here is a great document about health <a href = "https://medicalxpress.com/health-news/?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Bing%20Medical&utm_term=health%20article&utm_content=Health%2FHealth%20care"></a>
